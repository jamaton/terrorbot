my first coding project. 
Hi world, i havent made a computer code since the late 1990 when I made some simple games in BASIC on the BBC Micro at school. I would like to learn coding again so I can learn about AI, design games or puzzles, and in my wildest dream create an AI software to analyse real life sports.
